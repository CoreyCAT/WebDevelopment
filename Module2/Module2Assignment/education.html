    <h3>Elementary</h3>
    <p style="color:red;">I attended two schools during my elementary education. I went to Oakgrove lower, and then I went to longleaf. 
      Elementary was by far the most fun I have had in my entire educational career. I have so many good memories from this part of my life. </p>
    <h3>Middle School</h3>
    <p style="font-size:30pt;"> I attended Oak Grove Middle School.Middle was deffinently the worst part of school. 
      I'm not sure if anyone had a great time during middle school. It wasn't all bad though. I was in the band and I was also on the basketball team </p>
    <h3> High School</h3>
    <p>I am now at Oak Grove Highschool. From the very start Highschool was amazing. 
      Freshman year the single most fun year in school ever. Unfortunately though, This was brought to an end due to covid. 
      After spending half of my freshman year and all of my sophmore year virtual, I don't even feel like a junior. I barley know my way around the halls</p>
